# Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression model built in TensorFlow.js

## Description

The model trains at runtime according to the data points drawn on canvas, optimizes coefficients (by minimizing the MSE Loss function using Adam optimizer with a Learning Rate of 0.2) to get a best curve fitted line for the data points drawn on canvas.
